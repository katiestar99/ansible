Assible for Network Automation
******************************

Assible Network modules extend the benefits of simple, powerful, agentless automation to network administrators and teams. Assible Network modules can configure your network stack, test and validate existing network state, and discover and correct network configuration drift.

If you're new to Assible, or new to using Assible for network management, start with :ref:`network_getting_started`. If you are already familiar with network automation with Assible, see :ref:`network_advanced`.

For documentation on using a particular network module, consult the :ref:`list of all network modules<network_modules>`. Network modules for various hardware are supported by different teams including the hardware vendors themselves, volunteers from the Assible community, and the Assible Network Team.
