Control node
============

Any machine with Assible installed. You can run Assible commands and playbooks by invoking the ``assible`` or ``assible-playbook`` command from any control node. You can use any computer that has a Python installation as a control node - laptops, shared desktops, and servers can all run Assible. However, you cannot use a Windows machine as a control node. You can have multiple control nodes.

Managed nodes
=============

The network devices (and/or servers) you manage with Assible. Managed nodes are also sometimes called "hosts". Assible is not installed on managed nodes.

Inventory
=========

A list of managed nodes. An inventory file is also sometimes called a "hostfile". Your inventory can specify information like IP address for each managed node. An inventory can also organize managed nodes, creating and nesting groups for easier scaling. To learn more about inventory, see :ref:`the Working with Inventory<intro_inventory>` section.

Collections
===========

Collections are a distribution format for Assible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. You can install and use collections through `Assible Galaxy <https://galaxy.assible.com>`_. To learn more about collections, see :ref:`collections`.

Modules
=======

The units of code Assible executes. Each module has a particular use, from administering users on a specific type of database to managing VLAN interfaces on a specific type of network device. You can invoke a single module with a task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook. Starting in Assible 2.10, modules are grouped in collections. For an idea of how many collections Assible includes, take a look at the :ref:`list_of_collections`.

Tasks
=====

The units of action in Assible. You can execute a single task once with an ad-hoc command.

Playbooks
=========

Ordered lists of tasks, saved so you can run those tasks in that order repeatedly. Playbooks can include variables as well as tasks. Playbooks are written in YAML and are easy to read, write, share and understand. To learn more about playbooks, see :ref:`about_playbooks`.
