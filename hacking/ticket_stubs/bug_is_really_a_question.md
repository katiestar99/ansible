List Information
================

Hi!

Thanks very much for your interest in Assible.  It sincerely means a lot to us. 

This appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to either the mailing list or the IRC channel.

   * IRC: #assible on irc.freenode.net   
   * mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/assible-project

If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it.  This allows us to keep the issue tracker for bugs, pull requests, RFEs and the like.

Thank you once again and we look forward to seeing you on the list or IRC.  Thanks!
