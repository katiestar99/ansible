Internal Assible API
====================

Hi!

Thanks very much for your submission to Assible.  It sincerely means a lot to us
to have an active community that is willing to submit feedback so that we may
continue to make Assible better.

The internal Python API is considered an unsupported aspect of Assible and this
is not considered a bug unless there is an issue with an Assible binary
(`assible`, `assible-playbook`, `assible-doc`, etc) or an issue with an external
API such as are provided for the development of plugins (modules, dynamic
inventories, callbacks, strategies, etc).

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Assible!
