# This playbook exists to document the behavior of how run_once when
# applied to a dynamic include works
#
# As with other uses of keywords on dynamic includes, it only affects the include.
# In this case it causes the include to only be processed for assible_play_hosts[0]
# which has the side effect of only running the tasks on assible_play_hosts[0]
# and would only delegate facts of the include itself, not the tasks contained within
