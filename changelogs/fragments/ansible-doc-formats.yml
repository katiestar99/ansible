minor_changes:
  - assible-doc will now format, ``L()``, ``R()``, and ``HORIZONTALLINE`` in
    plugin docs just as the website docs do.  https://github.com/assible/assible/pull/71070
  - Fixed assible-doc to not substitute for words followed by parenthesis.  For
    instance, ``IBM(International Business Machines)`` will no longer be
    substituted with a link to a non-existent module.
